Trying to learn more about using image textures to give renders a more realistic feel.
Instead of the traditional metal ball approach, wanted to try to do it on Mandalorian helmets!

Love the Darth Maul like horns coming out of the back of her helmet. Might be a throwback to a time when Darth Maul was actually the ruler of Mandalore after defeating Pre Viszla.

Really liked how his helmet is significantly different from everyone else with more straight edges at the bottom half.

Bo-Katan Kryze up front, the Mand'alor -- the sole leader of the Mandalorian people. Also the sister of Satine Kryze, who was Obi-Wan's supposed love interest in the Clone Wars Animated Series. Axe Woves on the left, Koska Reeves on the right.

### The Fetts

Of course, the most popular bounty hunter, and now confirmed Mandalorian, Boba and Jango Fett. One interesting implication of this is that the entire Clone Army were made from the genes of a Mandalorian. This means that the biggest blow dealt to the survival of the Jedi were, in a way, dealt by their lifelong enemy -- the Mandalorians.
