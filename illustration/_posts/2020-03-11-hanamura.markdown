**First Blender project!** Wanted to do an isometric, minimalist version of Hanamura Point B similar to [this](https://magtanggol03.github.io/illustration/japan-iso), but realized might be fun to try making a 3D scene.

**Character 3D models not mine**, only modification was to simplify the models and added the color/materials. Both models can be found here: [Reinhardt by RealityMill](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3430911), [Brigitte by TheTNR](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2883075).

Was going to use Genji vs Hanzo but Reinhardt was easier to color haha.

Tried to do some very basic animation, but nothing impressive. Hoping to learn more moving forward!
