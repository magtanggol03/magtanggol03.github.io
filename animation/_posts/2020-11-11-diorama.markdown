Was inspired to do a rotating diorama by Andreas Wannerstedt's Google CES Diorama, so decided to make it my birthday project. Was having a difficult time coming up with fixtures to put in, so I placed key buildings/objects inspired by key milestones in my 29 years of existence.

I call it, the DioRAMa.

#### Warning -- rotation speed may cause headache if stared at for too long

### Education

It would be impossible to reflect on life so far without looking at the influences of my alma matter, Ateneo. This is a model of the iconic Church of the Gesu. Ateneo has been a place of learning, work and rest.
  
![HKUST](https://storage.googleapis.com/magtanggol-github-io/diorama/hkust.jpg)  
  
This is a model of the HKUST flame that is in the middle of the main building. It was relatively short, but always look back on it as a time of independence and growth. 

### Work

![Office](https://storage.googleapis.com/magtanggol-github-io/diorama/twenty-four-seven.jpg)

The building is the office that I used to spend majority of my time in and the globe represents more the geospatial work that I do. I miss the Dunkin Donuts where I would take a late lunch (Soup and Sandwich), and the office's anticipation of the opening of % Arabica that never happened.

The roulette is for the time I spent in the family business. This is a part of my life where I learned how most to deal with being pushed beyond my own comfort zone, teaching me a lot about grinding not just for a day job but for something more meaningful. Added in a tree for my boss.  

![Warehouse](https://storage.googleapis.com/magtanggol-github-io/diorama/warehouse.jpg)

My first job, which was in FMCG. Had the chance to experience a lot of different roles there, but the time I worked in logistics and distribution holds a special place in my heart.  
 
### Home

Places I call home. Models of our houses aka where I spent 99% of my 2020. Spent the most time on this since I had more references and wanted to make it feel distinctly our home rather than just generic buildings.

RESUME?! haha. Of course a lot of other milestones in life not captured here, but as always am limited by my ability to imagine and create things to put in. All of this was modelled and rendered in Blender.
